Q:
 What are the main mathematical formulas involved?

A:

Here are the main mathematical formulas involved in solving the infinite quantum well with the usual boundary conditions ($\psi(0) = 0$ and $\psi(a) = 0$):

\textbf{1. Time-independent Schrödinger Equation (SE):}

\begin{equation}
-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{d^2\psi}{dx^2} + V(x) \psi(x) = E \psi(x)
\end{equation}
\begin{itemize}
\item $\hbar$ (pronounced "h-bar") is the reduced Planck constant ($\approx 1.054 \times 10^{-34}$ J⋅s)
\item $m$ is the mass of the particle
\item $\frac{d^2\psi}{dx^2}$ is the second derivative of the wave function ($\psi$) with respect to position ($x$)
\item $V(x)$ is the potential energy function (0 inside the well, infinite outside)
\item $E$ is the total energy of the particle
\end{itemize}

\textbf{2. Separation of Variables:}

We assume the wave function can be written as a product of separate functions for the spatial ($X(x)$) and time-dependent ($T(t)$) parts (for generality, here):

\begin{equation}
\psi(x, t) = X(x) \cdot T(t)
\end{equation}

In the case of the infinite well, we focus on time-independent solutions, so $T(t)$ becomes a constant. This leaves us with:

\begin{equation}
\psi(x) = X(x)
\end{equation}

\textbf{3. Solution for Spatial Part ($X(x)$):}

Since $V(x) = 0$ inside the well, the ODE for the spatial part becomes:

\begin{equation}
-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{d^2X}{dx^2} = E X
\end{equation}

This has solutions of the form:

\begin{equation}
X(x) = A \sin(kx) + B \cos(kx)
\end{equation}

\begin{itemize}
\item $A$ and $B$ are constants determined by the boundary conditions
\item $k$ is the wave number (related to the wavelength $\lambda$ by $k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{4. Applying Boundary Conditions:}

The common boundary conditions for the infinite well are:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\psi(0) = 0$ (wave function is zero at $x = 0$)
\item $\psi(a) = 0$ (wave function is zero at $x = a$, well width)
\end{itemize}

Applying these conditions leads to:

\begin{align}
A\sin(0) + B\cos(0) &= 0  \quad \text{implies} \quad B = 0 \quad \text{(since} \cos(0) = 1\text{)} \\
A\sin(ka) &= 0  \quad \text{implies} \quad \sin(ka) = 0 \quad \text{(}A \neq 0 \text{ for non-zero wave function)}
\end{align}

\textbf{5. Quantization of Energy Levels:}

For $\sin(ka) = 0$, $ka$ must be an integer multiple of $\pi$:

\begin{equation}
ka = n\pi  \quad \text{where} \quad n \text{ is an integer} (0, 1, 2, \ldots)
\end{equation}

Relating $k$ to $\lambda$ (wavelength), we get:

\begin{equation}
n \lambda = 2a  \quad \text{where} \quad n \text{ is an integer} (1, 2, 3, \ldots)
\end{equation}

This equation shows that only specific wavelengths (and their corresponding wave functions) are allowed, leading to quantized energy levels.

\textbf{Additional Formulas:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Relationship between wave number ($k$) and momentum ($p$):  $p = \hbar k$
\item Energy-momentum relationship (for non-relativistic particles): $E = \frac{p^2}{2m}$
\end{itemize}
